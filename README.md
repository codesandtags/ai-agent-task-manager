# AI Agent Task Manager

A simple CLI-based AI Agent that uses OpenAIâ€™s API to interpret and manage tasks in natural language.

## Features

- **Add tasks** by describing them in normal speech (e.g., "Add a task to buy groceries tomorrow").
- **Complete tasks** by referencing an ID or part of the description (e.g., "Complete the groceries task").
- **List tasks** to see current tasks with their status and due dates.
- **Summarize tasks** using the LLM to generate a concise bullet list summary.
